  <h1>Instructions for using the Course websites</h1>
  
  <p>
    Welcome to the Canvas website for PHWM2998 - Introduction to R Programming for Epidemiologic Research. To complete this course, you will actually need to use a few additional websites as well. This may cause a little bit of confusion at first, but my hope is that it will allow you to access the best available tools for learning R programming and it will allow you to continue to access course resources long after the semester is completed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Here is a list of the websites we will use in this course along with a brief overview of how we will use them:</b>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><b>Canvas</b>: Submit assignments and quizzes, and view your grades on assignments and quizzes</li>
    <li><a href="https://brad-cannell.github.io/course-Introduction-to-R-Programming-for-Epidemiologic-Research/" target="_blank"><b>Introduction to R Programming for Epidemiologic Research Course Website</b></a>: View the course outline, view individual learning modules, and access links to course resources</li>
    <li><a href="https://intro-r-prog.slack.com" target="_blank"><b>Slack</b></a>: Our primary communication tool for this class</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank"><b>DataCamp</b></a>: A tool for practicing your R programming online and getting real-time feedback</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    You should not have to do anything special to access the course website -- just click on the link above. I also recommend that you bookmark the course website in your browser of choice.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Before you can use Slack or DataCamp, you will need to sign up for a free account with both. Below are some instructions for doing so.

  <h1>Using Slack</h1>
  
  <p><i>What is Slack?</i></p>
  
  <p>Slack is a tool for communication, collaboration, and sharing resources. For the purposes of our class, you can think of Slack as a replacement for email, discussion boards, and cloud-based file sharing (e.g., Dropbox). If you are interested, you can read <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768" target="_blank">a short introduction to Slack article here</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c7_TpPUpL0" target="_blank">view a short demo video here.</a></p>
  
  <p><i>Why are we using Slack?</i></p>
  
  <p>"Okay, Brad. Slack looks cool, but why not just use the email, discussion boards, and cloud-based file sharing capabilities that Canvas already has?" The primary reason is because it benefits YOU! At the end of the semester, you will lose access to course-related materials that are on Canvas. However, you will be able to access Slack for the foreseeable future.</p>
  
  <p><i>How do I access the course workspace on Slack?</i></p>
  
  <p>I've already created a Slack workspace for this course, which is accessible at <a href="https://intro-r-prog.slack.com" target="_blank">https://intro-r-prog.slack.com</a>. You can <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members" target="_blank">read about joining a Slack workspace here</a>. Keep in mind, <b>you must use your "@uth.tmc.edu" email address to sign up for our Slack workspace.</b></p>
  
  <p>Additional questions? Go ahead and log into Slack and post them in the #general channel!</p>

  <h1>Using DataCamp</h1>
  
  <p><i>What is DataCamp?</i></p>
  
  <p>DataCamp is an incredible resource for interactively learning to program in R, Python, and SQL. The website is broken into topic-specific courses that include videos, readings, and interactive coding sessions that provide you with immediate feedback about any errors in your code. Typically, you have to pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee to access DataCamp courses. However, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education" target="_blank">DataCamp for the Classroom</a> allows me to provide you with access to all of DataCamp's courses free of charge for 6 months. All you have to do is register!</p>
  
  <p><i>How do I get free access to DataCamp?</i></p>
  
  <p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/dc7b2ea2a51b3f1c6d12631d5b3cf92460832c3a" target="_blank">To access DataCamp for free, just click on this link and follow the setup instructions</a></p>
  
  <p>Remember, you must register using your <b>@uth.tmc.edu email address.</b></p>
