```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

By default, `tutorial` will convert all R chunks.

```{r}
a <- 2
b <- 3

a + b
```

It works, even embedded in an iframe on a Canvas page. However, I don't think we can [easily] load data into the R chunk this way. We will probably still want to use the teach editor for most of the coding exercises.
